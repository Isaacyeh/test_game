This project is brought to you by some bored high school students

This project is a browser-based DOOM-style 2.5D ray-casting game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring:
- Real-time multiplayer via WebSockets
- Classic ray-casting renderer

This project is inspired by early FPS engines like DOOM and Wolfenstein 3D, but runs entirely in the browser.

How to run the code (for my less informed friends):

There are multiple ways to run the code.

1. Preview: You can download all the code directly off of Github then open index.html.
- This is an excelent way to preview the game, however this is only a single-player preview.
- If you want to play multi-player over the web, try the next few options.

2. Local host: Go to your preffered IDE, connect this repo and open a local host. step by step (simplest way):
- change the .com into .dev from the repo's link (github.com -> github.dev), this takes you to the github workspace (or vscode.dev) (or any other IDEs)
- then open terminal and open a codespace (this game requires node.js, which should be prebuilt in most IDEs)
- open terminal in the codespace again
- type "npm install" (just in case)
- then type "npm start"
-  go to ports and chose either open preview or open in browser
-  P.S. share the link to play with a friend

3. Server:
- ugg i dont feel like explaining, iykyk
- for personal use just use local host
- if you really feel like learning search up free web servers (i recommend render)
